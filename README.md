# BloKi - A minimalistic Blog and Wiki Engine

If you want a small, simple, easy to use, high performance, micro blog/wiki platform and you're tired of, or afraid to even touch WordPress, MediaWiki, LAMP, this might be for you.

## Main features

- No PHP, Apache, Nginx, JavaScript and SQL.

- The web based Admin UI resembles WordPress and MediaWiki, but without all the bloat.

- Articles and media are stored as regular files. Apart from web admin - editable in any editor of your choice! Versioned by Git.

- The server software is a single file, statically linked, self contained binary. Runs on most modern OSes without any external dependencies, scripting runtimes, libraries, etc. Easily host your blog on a Raspberry PI, small VM, Docker container, Lambda or Cloud Run function.

- BloKi supports modern, low end, legacy, vintage and even text mode browsers. User editable themes.


## Current status
