# BloKi - A minimalistic Blog and Wiki Platform

If you want an ultra small, simple, easy to use, high performance, micro blog/wiki platform and you're tired of, or afraid to even touch WordPress, MediaWiki, LAMP, this might be for you.

## Main features

- No PHP, Apache, Nginx, JavaScript and SQL.

- The UI, resembles WordPress and MediaWiki, but without all the bloat. There are user editable themes based on simple .html/css template files. 

- Different HTML templates for modern, legacy and vintage web browsers. BloKi supports modern, low end, legacy and text mode browsers.

- Web based admin interface with built-in markdown editor. However, the articles and media are stored as regular files. Editable in any editor of your choice. Versioned by Git. In future it will support S3 buckets.

- The server software is a single file, statically linked, self contained binary. Runs on most modern OSes without any external dependencies, scripting runtimes, libraries, etc. Easily host your blog on a Raspberry PI, small VM, Docker container, Lambda or Cloud Run function.


## Current status
