# BloKi - A minimalistic Blog and Wiki Platform

If you want an ultra small, simple, easy to use, high performance, micro blog/wiki platform. Also you're tired of, or afraid to even touch WordPress, MediaWiki, LAMP, this might be for you.

## Current status

- Blog engine works if articles and media are created on a disk by hand
- Admin interface is coming up next

Development progress can be tracked on [dogfood blog](https://blog.tenox.net/)
